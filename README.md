How do I approach designing software?
I approached the design by searching for images that would be easy to replicate. Once found, I then began to think on what my plane would contain. As I choose to design a vintage van, I decided that either a parking lot or a parking garage would be my plane. It would change to the parking garage as it allowed for me to use different 3D shapes. 
Each module prepared me for my final project from drawing the 3D shapes, to producing the scene lighting, textures, and colors. If I were to choose a design process it would be an iterative design process as I did continuous refinement based on feedback and testing. Starting from the initial design based on the requirements, I then moved on to creating a prototype to validate the design decisions and refine them based on the testing portion. Tactics to take from my design approach for future work would be thorough requirement analysis, modular design, and iterative refinement. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I find that organization can be a good tool when developing programs. With each module project/assignment, it was easy to read through the code by looking for the comments that contained the section's name. Visual Studios, dark theme helps this stand out as it in a bright green color. Iteration played an important role in the development process. As I refined the scene layout, shader effects, and rendering based on visual feedback and performance profiling. Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code evolved from focusing on basic functionality to a consideration of performance.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides a foundation of problem-solving skills, theoretical knowledge, and practical techniques. Computational graphics and visualizations offer insights into fundamental principles of mathematics, physics, and computer science. Providing practical experience in implementing algorithms and techniques for rendering and simulating complex phenomena.
